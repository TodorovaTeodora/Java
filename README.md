The task is to draw a logo in the shape of 2 letters M. The letters are represented with "*" and the spaces are represented with "-". The input must be an odd integer between 3 and less than 10 000.
I decided to use OOP principles so that the code could be more readble and reusable - in case you want to draw the same structure with different characters.
